&& cd open62541 && mkdir build && cd build \
&& cmake -DUA_NAMESPACE_ZERO=FULL \
      -DUA_ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS=ON \
      -DUA_ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS_EVENTS=ON \
      -DUA_ENABLE_DA=ON \
      -DUA_ENABLE_METHODCALLS=ON \
      -DUA_ENABLE_NODEMANAGEMENT=ON \
      -DUA_ENABLE_ENCRYPTION=OFF \
      .. \
&& make -j7 && make install
```

#### Catch2 v2.13.4 (testing)

# Content:
 - OPC_UA Models: The OPC_UA models used in the SAMYCore (CRCL, DI, Robotics, fortiss_di, fortiss_robotics)
 - Tests: testing block for the CRCL information model.
 - build: contains some (correctly) autogenerated files that can be used as reference
 - configFiles_examples: examples of configuration files than are required by the SAMYCore
 - src: Source code of the SAMYCore
 - ThirdPart: External header-only libraries
 - Tools: Scripts for different purposes
 - Skills: Place in this folder you scripted skills. The SAMYCore will automatically look for them and load them (more info coming)
